Barely midnight and my silhouette is cast by large venetian blinds.

I took a walk this afternoon around my office park grounds. There is an
outdoor stage that's apparently used for concerts, although I haven't
seen any activity there before. A couple neat views below.

Incorrect white balance setting accounts for the blue tone. I would
correct it if I didn't think it looked so neat.
