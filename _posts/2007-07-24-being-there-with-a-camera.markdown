  content: And of course Murpy's Law states that you will always encounter the best
    photo opportunities the *one* time you leave your camera at home!  I try and carry
    my camera everywhere, and I've gotten some great, unexpected shots that I would
    have missed if I hadn't brought it.

    Cole's Law: Thinly sliced cabbage.

    But seriously, you're more right than I would like to admit, Ed. I've missed plenty of great opportunities because I left it at home (it's at home right now... I hope nothing spectacular happens).

    As I glossed over in the post, having a pocket-sized camera of good quality (the Canon SD800 IS would be my personal choice, though I don't own one), or stripping down your DSLR (or backup DSLR if you're one of those nut cases with two) to its bare minimum profile with a small lens can really help in removing the convenience barrier.

    The first two photos jumped right out at me!

    I love the way you captured the striated clouds in the first one, that's one of my favourite cloud formations. It always makes me think of another ocean above us, waves slowly advancing across the surface.

    The yellow tone of the second bothered me a bit initially, but I grew to like it after looking at it a couple more times. The train blur is a nice effect; using flat surfaces to steady a camera in low-light situations is always rewarding.

    Glad to see you appreciated the advice I gave out! ...Now if only I could follow it &gt;

There's been more talk than usual lately about keeping a camera with
you; taking it places you might not normally take it; the disappointment
of missing what could have been a great image if only you had; and the
question of whether having the camera with you, though not at the ready,
would even help.

Opinions differ, but you can't lose by having the camera around even if
you don't think you'll use it. I happened to be driving around
Narragansett Bay (actually, across it) in Rhode Island this weekend and,
because I was there specifically to take some family portraits, I
thankfully had my camera with me and was able to capture this scene.

This was taken from the Newport side of the Claiborne Pell Bridge, which
connects Newport (on Aquidneck Island) in the west to Conanicut Island
(chiefly the town of Jamestown) to the east.

The following evening, I took [some
advice](http://www.goldengod).net/2007/07/17/why-you-should-take-your-camera-with-you-always/
to heart, took the battery grip off of my old Canon 10D, strapped on my
50mm f/1.4 (my smallest lens), and went for a walk by the city pier. I
enjoy walking down there because it's quite scenic and with the harbor
and train station in close proximity you never know what you'll be able
to see.

Here is an 8:15 Amtrak Acela departing for points unknown (probably
Boston, eventually). I braced my camera against one of those I-beams you
see ahead of me. No tripod necessary!

A close-up of a vendor's cart parked along the side of the pier,
probably left over from [Sailfest](http://www.sailfest.org). I liked the
reflection in it and the texture of it.

A handsome public observation binocular lit by the lights on the pier
overlooks the Thames River and the General Dynamics building on the far
shore. General Dynamics, previously known as Electric Boat, is a major
submarine defense contractor and a significant source of income for the
southeast Connecticut shoreline.

General Dynamics itself glimmers against the water. I was shooting JPEG
(the 10D is so slow with RAW) and I set the white balance to "cloudy"
for this shot to enhance its redness.

On my walk back home, this sailor's monument caught my eye.

I think the moral of the story is that it's better to have your "second
string" camera with you, stripped down to its most convenient minimum,
than to have no camera at all!
