the photo of the singer isn't great, (the lighting in the iron horse is
pisspoor and I admit i don't have proper camera equipment anymore) BUTi
don't give a rat's patoot... because... i saw my favorite singer in the
world to see last night at the iron horse. a singer i've seen in
california, boston, northampton, etc... anyone who has ever met me knows
the rhett miller/old 97s love that i have... the potential of much hand
clapping and a permanent smile... and then i got coffee and ice cream in
the rain and walked around on the drizzly streets of northampton. nearly
perfect.
