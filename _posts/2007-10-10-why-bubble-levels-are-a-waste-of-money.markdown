    @monty

    That's a very good point! I should have mentioned that I really intended this editorial to be directed at landscape and outdoors photographers and I didn't even consider the usefulness of a bubble level for indoor and tabletop work. Thanks for your insights.

  content: I have to agree with your new-found military friend.  If you're shooting
    sequential landscape images that you intend to stitch together into a panorama,
    a bubble level is nearly indispensable.  Can there really be a quantifiable difference
    betweeen a hot shoe level and one built onto the tripod?  The focusing screen
    on my Olympus E-1 has a grid etched (?) into it, and I find it more than handy.

    @Rich

    In my opinion, a grid or some markings within the viewfinder is _ten times_ more useful than a bubble level simply because those anchors relate directly to the composition itself rather than to the gravitational "levelness" of your camera, which may or may not jive with what you're shooting.

    One extreme example I thought of is shooting a panorama off a tower of some kind where you want to tilt your camera downward. A hot shoe level becomes useless in that situation, and although a tripod level may help you out a bit, you're really better off swinging the camera around while looking through it to make sure you'll frame all the highest and lowest points of interest.

    Many SLR cameras now have focusing and grid screens available for them, and while they are expensive, they could prove to be worth their weight in gold when shooting things like panoramas. The 5D and 1-series Canon bodies have a couple of screens available from Canon, and screens for those and other cameras are also available from cool third-parties like [Haoda](http://haodascreen.com/default.aspx).

    Thanks, Gary.

    The Hakuba level shown in the picture has both a horizontal as well as vertical bubble cylinder, though the horizontal one is difficult to see properly from the angle of the photograph because of the distortion of the clear acrylic.

    That said, I *still* think these things are a waste of money.

    I have read this article and, for the most part, agree with you.  There are a lot of places a bubble level has little to no use.  On the other hand, a lot of the arguments you make can also be said for any other photography tool.  Take a camera's built in exposure sensor for example.  They are always a nice thing to have, but they aren't always perfectly accurate.  Should we stop using the exposure meter just because it isn't always accurate?  No.  It isn't always perfect, but it gets you in the ballpark.  A photographer who knows their camera will know when to trust this tool and when to go with their instinct.

    I take a lot of skyline pictures.  They are mostly cityscapes at night.  In a lot of places, there is no point of reference or horizon line to line your camera up with.  You have roads, signs, trees and buildings in the way.  You can go with the vertical sides of the building, but you soon find out that they aren't always accurate.  Those lines can be deceiving, especially when lining it up through a tiny viewfinder.  Sure, the picture will look great in your viewfinder and on the small LCD screen.  I have spent many nights taking picture for 2 or 3 hours from one location or another attempting to use my eye to get the shot straight.  Then, I get home and find that most of my shots are just slightly off.  Sure, I could post-process the pictures, but that tends to degrade the quality of a picture, almost adding a blurred look to the photographs.  I would rather have a tool available to me so I can check and see if what I think is accurate is, in fact, accurate.  I never become dependent on this tool and always go with my eye, but it still gives me a second opinion when I am standing on a bridge at 1am in 12 degree weather and am unsure if my eyes are playing tricks on me or not.

    I am not going to say the bubble level in my hotshoe has solved all of my problems, but since I started using it, it has greatly cut down on uneven pictures.

    I look at it this way:  If I am building a table, I probably won't need wire cutters.  Do I have a pair in my toolbag?  Absolutely!

    @Jeff

    Thanks for sharing your experience with bubble levels! I am on your side when it comes to the (limited) utility of bubble levels in landscape photography. There are definitely times and places where a bubble level is nothing short of indispensable.

    One of my main points in writing this piece is that people tend to take things like bubble levels at face value. Just because the little air bubble rests serenely between the two lines doesn't mean that the photograph will appear to be level in any way.

    The biggest challenge that I've faced when it comes to leveling photographs is when there is a visual contention between a horizon-like line, such as the edge of a beach (which is not actually the horizon), and the vertical edges of buildings or trees. It can be a challenge to make the image _seem_ balanced and in a state of rest, whether or not the image is technically, physically, level.

    What you said about straightening images in post-production is most certainly true, too. Nevertheless, shooting at 12 megapixels seems to be enough to handle some light perspective adjustment without a noticeable loss of sharpness in my experience and I've done so many times with city skyline photographs in lieu of buying an expensive tilt/shift lens.

    Thanks again for sharing, Jeff.

There may be a time and a place for a real bubble level, but I happen to
think that it's in carpentry. I'll tell you why.

![Hakuba Bubble
Level](http://singleservingphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/HakubaLevel1.jpg "Hakuba Bubble Level")

In this day and age, you can buy nearly any piece of photographic
equipment with a bubble level built into it somewhere. Tripods, ball
heads, camera brackets, and even little standalone levels that clip into
your hot shoe like the one shown above (made by Hakuba). Do I think
these products are clever? Absolutely. Do I recommend purchasing one?
Not really.<span id="more"></span><span id="more-148"></span>

If you're building a house, making sure things are level is pretty
important. You probably wouldn't want to walk uphill from your living
room to your kitchen, for example. In photography, however, we're
talking about making art, about expressing emotion, about things far
divorced from the mechanics of building robust structures for people to
live in.

The bubble level started showing up in photography equipment to help
people level their images with the precept that keeping your image level
is a good thing. I can't argue with that; if you have a noticeable
horizon line in your image and it isn't wildly and purposefully
off-kilter, it should darn well be horizontal. If it _is_ wildly and
purposefully off-kilter, you don't really need a bubble level to do
that.

There are three reasons I believe these bubble levels are useless:

\# Bubble levels integrated into tripods are fundamentally worthless
because they only tell you if your tripod is level, and unless you have
your camera screwed directly onto your tripod (please, please answer
"no" to that), it doesn't do you much good. A tripod can be very steady
and secure without being level.\
 \# A bubble level on your camera does not guarantee that it is level
with the _surface_ of the ground (read: what you see), but rather that
it is level _gravitationally_, which may be different. If you are
shooting a horizon line that is actually a subtle hill or other
topographical feature, the bubble level may actually make your image
appear _not_ to be level.\
 \# Fundamentally, your final image may appear to be level or not level
based on features of the composition, including hills, vertical elements
such as trees or man-made structures, and so forth. A bubble level isn't
savvy to composition.

Basically, bubble levels only help you if you're shooting a _water
horizon_, which positively must be gravitationally level because it's
_water_, or if you're shooting a scene where gravitationally level is
exactly what you want regardless of any other topographical features,
such as wide angles of mountain ranges, deserts, and so on.

For my money, I'd rather adjust the frame by eye than buy a doohickey to
do it for me and hope that my situation lends itself to the device's
abilities.

Okay, so, how do you level the frame _without_ a bubble level? Here
are a couple of tricks I use:

\# Use your autofocus points. If it's daytime and you can see your
autofocus points, align them with elements in the scene to make sure
they're level. the AF points in your viewfinder are guaranteed to be
level with respect to the frame, so it gives you a visual hand-hold for
lining up horizons and buildings and everything else.\
 \# Squint. Seriously. One of the more important habits I've picked up
over the years is to take stock of the entire frame as a composition,
which can be hard to do when your face is pressed up against the camera
and you have one eye closed and you're possibly contorting yourself to
lean over to where your tripod is perched. If there is a horizon and a
tree that should appear to be horizontal and vertical, respectively, pay
careful attention to how they _appear_ to be oriented within the frame
as a whole rather than how the horizon or the tree line up with AF
points or edges of the frame on their own.\
 \# Fix it in post-processing. I know, that sounds like a cop out, but
it's your last line of defense. If you're going to be editing all of
your photos anyway (as I'm sure you do), it's a better investment to
tweak the horizon a little in Lightroom than to buy a bubble level and
wind up having to tweak it in Lightroom anyway since the horizon wasn't
gravitationally level in the first place.

At the end of the day, having one of those little gizmos is probably a
net benefit if you know when to use it and when not to use it. But for
my money, I'd rather concern myself with the aesthetics of the
composition as it appears through the viewfinder than whether or not my
camera is gravitationally level or not.

*Edit!* I ran into a very congenial gentleman here in the Great Smoky
Mountains who was on leave from the Army, preparing for his third tour
in Iraq, camping and photographing in the park. He was shooting some
panoramas with his D200 and told me that a hot shoe bubble level is
_essential_ in that case. Now, I could probably go out on a limb and
argue against that point, but instead I will concede that shooting
panoramas sounds like a pretty good reason to use a bubble level. One of
the *few*.
