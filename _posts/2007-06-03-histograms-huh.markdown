    @Gabriel

    It seems to me that the RAW data may have to be massaged somewhat in order for the histogram to make sense to the user (why or how I am not certain of), but it would defeat the purpose of the histogram to display the data after processing by the JPEG system because that system (in Canon cameras, the DIGIC processor) often changes the tone curve as part of its enhancement process, so I'm confident that it isn't true for Canon cameras at least.

    I could do an experiment, taking the same photo in JPEG and in RAW mode and see if the histogram appears different on the screen. Perhaps I will.

    @Gabriel

    Thanks for the link. I sincerely believe that there is no substitute for experience. Before digital was so ubiquitous, the light meter was the best information you could get about the exposure characteristics of a scene and I think we can agree that some of the most timeless and iconic photographs in history were made with a combination of the light meter and experience. I also believe that the histogram is incalculably useful to those who know how to read it, even if it's an approximation based on compressed data.

    When it comes to information, the more the merrier!

I don't think there is a single digital photographer who hasn't, at one
time or another, looked at a histogram (much like the one below) and
thought _What the fuzz is this thing trying to tell me?_ If that
describes you, or if you just want to know more about this ubiquitous
and curious graph, you've come to the right place.

![](/articles/Histograms/Figure-1.gif)

Today I will unclothe the common histogram and show you not only how to
read it, but also how you can use it to strengthen your work.<span
id="more"></span><span id="more-122"></span>

The histogram is a very powerful tool because it provides an instant
window to image information that is otherwise very difficult for a
person to get a sense of. According to the Photoshop CS manual,

bq. A histogram illustrates how pixels in an image are distributed by
graphing the number of pixels at each color intensity level. This can
show you whether the image contains enough detail in the shadows (shown
in the left part of the histogram), midtones (shown in the middle), and
highlights (shown in the right part) to make a good correction.

Most importantly for photographers, the histogram shows you this subtle
highlight and shadow information in a way that is completely independent
of your monitor's capabilities and color profiling.

Great, so it shows us detail information, or something like that. What
does that mean exactly? As stated in Adobe's definition above, the left
side of the histogram represents the darkest pixels in the image, while
the right side represents the lightest pixels. The height of each "bar"
(in a Photoshop histogram, each bar is one pixel wide) represents how
many pixels of that precise brightness exist in the image relative to
all the other brightnesses. All of this is much easier to understand if
you can see it. So, here:

![](/articles/Histograms/Figure-2.gif)

I have conveniently numbered each shaded area of the image and their
corresponding histogram bars. The first thing you should notice is that
the bars move toward the right of the histogram as the shade gets
lighter. Because areas one, two, and three get progressively lighter by
exactly the same amount, their bars in the histogram are evenly
separated. Likewise for areas four through seven.

The next thing to notice is the height of the bars. How are the heights
of these bars calculated? An important note when looking at any
histogram in Photoshop is that the graph is _scaled_ so there is never
any "wasted" vertical space. In this case, bars one, two, and three are
precisely one quarter the size of the entire image, so even though the
number of pixels in each of those sections is precisely one quarter the
number of pixels in the entire image, the bars are not one quarter the
height of the histogram. Why? Because there is no single shade of pixel
that has a higher _count_ than any of those sections (one, two, or
three). The graph is _scaled_ vertically.

Okay, so why are the bars for sections four through seven as tall as
they are? Each of those four sections of the image is _one quarter_
the size of section one or two or three (as you can probably tell just
by looking), so their bars in the histogram are _one quarter_ the
height of the bars for sections one, two, and three. Is this all making
some sense?

Just by looking at this histogram (which is harder to read by virtue of
its sparsity, but bear with me), we can actually see that the image must
contain precisely seven distinct pixel brightnesses ranging from
completely black to completely white (and look, it does!). Furthermore,
we can see (for example) that there are about one quarter as many pixels
of brightness four than there are of brightness three. Fantastic.

So what happens when the image has *many more* shades in it? Let's
say, for example, that it has *every* shade in it.

![](/articles/Histograms/Figure-3.gif)

Be honest: is the histogram at all what you would've expected it to be?
I was a bit surprised to see that curve in there, but it does show us
some things about the Photoshop gradient tool that we might not have
known before!

We have already drawn the first conclusion from this histogram: it
contains *every possible shade* of pixel. We know this because the
data begins at the very left edge and proceeds all the way to the very
right edge without a single gap. What happens if a shade is removed?

![](/articles/Histograms/Figure-4.gif)

The attentive among you will notice that *two* changes have occurred.
First, there is a pretty obvious gap where that particular shade of gray
was removed. Second, the bar at the very right edge is now filled in.
Why? Because I covered the gray shade with a _white_ line, so the
count of white pixels has now increased! Brilliant.

Let's make a more drastic change and see how that affects the histogram
display:

![](/articles/Histograms/Figure-5.gif)

I have now removed most of the dark tones in the example image. Notice
that the histogram has a huge gap on the left side. No matter how large
or small your image is, the histogram always ranges from 100% black on
the left to 100% white on the right. Also notice that the tallest bar is
the one at the far right, for 100% white. This is because there are more
completely white pixels than pixels of any other brightness in the
image, so the histogram is now _scaled_ to the height of that bar (the
tallest bar).

By now you should be pretty comfortable getting the following
information out of a histogram:

\# The range of tones in an image; does the image contain completely
black and completely white tones, and is it missing tones anywhere in
the range?\
 \# Which tones occur most often in the image; which bars in the
histogram touch the top?

That's a good start, but it won't make you more proficient at editing
your photographs. Let's take a look at a real example to see how what
we've learned applies to a photo.

![](/articles/Histograms/Figure-6.jpg)

Here is a photograph that I made at one of the (many) tobacco fields up
in Windsor, Connecticut. It was a foggy morning and, as you can see from
the histogram, there are no very light tones in this image at all (you
can tell by the large gap on the right side). Notice also that there is
not a significant amount of black (the curve on the left doesn't begin
immediately at the left edge).

I want to evenly brighten this image so that the sky area becomes white.
I will use levels for this (which I won't explain; there are ample
articles for using levels), but you could also use curves. Once I've
brightened the image, it might look more like this:

![](/articles/Histograms/Figure-7.jpg)

There are two important things to notice about this histogram. First,
you may wonder why it's full of gaps. These gaps are a side-effect of
expanding the tonal range of an 8-bit image; Photoshop shifts and
redistributes the tones in the image to give the best perceptual result,
but it doesn't (and cannot) create more pixels with intermediate tones
to complete the entire tonal range. This is one of the linchpins in the
8-bit versus 16-bit editing debate, which I may cover in a later
article.

Second, you will notice that I now have a significant amount of pure
white in the image (the very last bar on the right goes all the way to
the top of the histogram), and the curve appears to be "cut off." This
is _usually_ a bad thing, because it tells you that you have _lost
highlight detail_. If this were a high-key portrait, or if your intent
was to wash out the sky to pure white, you would have succeeded. I
didn't mean to do that, though, so I'm going to undo that change and try
again.

![](/articles/Histograms/Figure-8.jpg)

The changes in the photograph itself might be very subtle and difficult
to see on your monitor. This is the _entire point_ of the histogram.
By reading the histogram, you can tell what's going on even if you can't
see it in the photo. Notice that I have not clipped as much of the
highlight area of the tone curve, leaving almost no pure white at all.
This tells me that my sky is going to be filled almost entirely with
_delicious digital sensor noise_, which will give it a more continuous
tone and realistic feeling.

By keeping an eye on your histogram, you can quickly and easily evaluate
whether or not you've achieved the result you were after. If your camera
has the ability to display a histogram you can even do this evaluation
_in the field_. I personally use the histogram display on my Canon 5D
just about 100% of the time; once I have seen the composition through
the viewfinder, what I'm most concerned with is the exposure, and the
histogram allows me to see that no matter how bright or dark it is, and
no matter how accurate the camera's LCD display is. A truly valuable
tool!

That's it for our in-depth examination of the histogram and all of its
exploits! I hope you've enjoyed digging into the mechanics of this very
useful tool and if you have any remaining questions or if you think I
screwed up anywhere along the way, please leave a comment!

## Lightroom, Lightroom, Lightroom, Lightroom

![](http://singleservingphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/Adobe-Photoshop-Lightroom-3-Software-for-Mac-Windows--150x150.jpg "Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 3 Software for Mac & Windows")

While reading histograms directly on your camera is the first step
toward complete control of your exposure, no digital photographer should
overlook the importance of post-processing. When Adobe released
Lightroom, I was already using Apple's Aperture, but after only a few
hours, I was ready to switch. I was a Lightroom pre-release beta tester
and I have purchased every upgrade to Lightroom ever since; it's
literally the killer app of killer apps.

Lightroom takes the histogram to the next level with RGB graphs and
over- and under-exposure views that actually show you on the photo
itself where you're losing detail. Not only is Lightroom an
indispensable tool for developing photographs, it's an awesome way to
learn how imaging works.

If you haven't purchased Lightroom yet, let me urge you now, please,
please buy it. It will change the way you develop and organize your
photos. On top of that, if you buy it from B&H at their great price, and
use one of the links below, you help me keep this site online... Which I
would really appreciate. Using these links does not change your cost in
any way, shape, or form.

If you are a student or a teacher, you can get a _huge_ discount by
purchasing the second one; it's absolutely identical in every way
