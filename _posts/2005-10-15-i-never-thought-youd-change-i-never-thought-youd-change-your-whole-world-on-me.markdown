so... just what everyone wanted! more band photos that are poorly taken
by me with bad lighting that no one cares about! but, see, it tells a
story... a story OF ROCK. this time, it is my bestest most favoritest
band in the whole world... no intention! i love them all pretty hard.
and tonite, wonder of all wonders, i got my wish to hear my favorite
song! they practiced it and rocked pearl street harder than your mom.
so, sit back and enjoy these photos of jed and josh.
