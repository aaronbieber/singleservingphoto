  content: This particular Ronald McDonald looks like he's crying on the inside. His
    mouth agape and eyes wide open as if to say, "Please, let me out of this bronze
    cocoon!" But he has to keep smiling and riding that unicycle because... bronze
    can't move.

Wow it's been so long since I've posted! But never fear, gentle readers,
I have not abandoned thee. I had the opportunity to spend time in
Chicago and meet a friend of mine who was kind enough to show me around
the city for three days. See many more of my Chicago photographs on my
[personal photography
gallery](http://gallery.thebailiwick.com/chicago_2006)!

Here are a few I liked a lot. A couple are also on the other site.

A cool sculpture.\

 I was literally *jarred* by this spiraling staircase.\

 This is the freaky-looking Ronald McDonald in front of the former
Rock'n'Roll McDonald's.\
