[![Shuichi Takayama, photographed by Tomohiro Ohsumi for

It's a sad day for Olympus, the venerable maker of both artistic and
scientific optics equipment based in Japan. Business news outlets are
reporting that Olympus has allegedly covered up decades of financial
losses through questionably large payments to advisers and other tricks
that could only be described as "cooking the books."

Bloomberg's photographer Tomohiro Ohsumi captured the photo at right of
Olympus president Shuichi Takayama bowing his head during a news
conference. On the front page of the Olympus global site, Takayama
writes:

bq. We wish to make a profound apology for all of the distress and
trouble caused due to the recent series of media reports and fall in the
stock prices triggered by our recent change in President.

No business executive longs to write words like those.
