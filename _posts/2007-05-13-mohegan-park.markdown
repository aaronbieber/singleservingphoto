I walked along a few random trails at Mohegan Park up in Norwich today,
snapping anything I thought looked promising. This is a fairly good
example of how bright, mid-day light can still be completely usable (if
not indispensable) when shooting under the forest canopy.

For this one, I made sure the sky wasn't visible and compensated -2/3
EV; perfect tonal range.

This one's one of my favorites. During the conversion to black and white
I darkened the yellows and lightened the greens to emphasize the
contrast on the ferns' leaves in the foreground.

Here are a couple of cutesy ones.

In this piece, a creative vignette adds drama and depth to an already
shallow depth of field.

I love tree bark.

I swear I actually found this lying there, just as it is.
