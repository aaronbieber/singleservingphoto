i saw the old classic dracula silent film " nosferatu" with a live band
playing an eerie, most wonderul score, live. I didn't know whether to
watch the electric violin player playing his bow on some cymbals or the
film. the movie skipped and jumped on the screen behind. the loud CRASH
of the drums startled me at times. The seats we sat in were old and not
too comfortable, but i had an amazing time. i was aiming to see fancy
trash, one of my favorite local bands, play that evening, but alas, we
walked by as they were playing, instead hovering in the doorway of the
iron horse and listening to 4 or 5 songs. i wish i had more nights like
that.

the odd guy doing announcements before the movie OBVIOUSLY doesn't know
to watch out for Nosferatu's shadow!

sorry, fancy trash, we were too late, lazy and not wanting to part with
money to see your show, but it sounded great from out here!
