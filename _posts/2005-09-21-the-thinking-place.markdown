I work in an ancient converted factory. Each bathroom is unique. One is
a faded shade of salmon and has dusty silk flowers in it. One is drab
with peeling grey paint. This is the view from the 2nd floor blue
bathroom. It reminds me of a middle school lavatory. Sometimes it smells
like plastic and glue and I can hear music through the vents coming from
my office above. I always pause to look out the window before heading
back upstairs to work.
