  content: "Great article, Aaron!  I've got a couple of questions:\r\n\r\n1)  I'd
    like to start purchasing some ND filters and I know B W is a good brand (and much
    more affordable that Lee or Singh-Ray).  If were to purchase just one filter to
    start, would the ND 4 be the best choice?\r\n\r\n2) With regards to the slim mount,
    at what lens size should this be considered - 20mm or wider?  Also, if the multi-coated
    lens fits the budget, better to go with it?\r\n\r\nOK, that was actually 3 questions...thanks
    for your response!"

    Thanks for commenting, Lou!

    As for what filters to start buying, it really depends on what you're going to be trying to do. If you want to use them for architectural photography (blurring tourists until they disappear), the stronger the better, although bear in mind that the filter is going to play games with your autofocus, so the darker it is the more often you may have to focus and frame with the filter off and then screw it on for the shot.

    You can probably imagine based on the f-stop equivalents how difficult it will be to see through the filter and focus, depending on the available light. In daylight, you may able to focus and shoot just fine through an ND64.

    I think most folks who want to be able to do a variety of the techniques I listed up above will have a couple of densities, and most kits start you out with ND1, ND2, and ND3. I would maybe go a bit higher and start with ND4, ND8, and ND16 or something along those lines.

    As for the slim filters, I don't know if there is a specific "cutoff" focal length for them, you may have to experiment.

    Multi-coated definitely can't hurt. If you are very concerned about the potential for flare, bear in mind also that stacking filters increases flare. Lots of folks keep their UV filters on all the time to protect the front lens element; take it off when using the ND filter to minimize flare!

    Hey Richard.

    Totally legitimate quibble! I meant that the majority of "L" and "Nikkor" lenses are 77mm diameter, and in fact that has always been, to me, one of the significant boons to using "L" lenses (apart from the excellent glass quality, of course). Before I stepped up to "L," when I was getting started in photography, I remember having a whole variety of different lens diameters to have to deal with, which was pretty inconvenient!

    Thanks for the note on the 35 and 135; the moral of the story is _know your lens diameter!_

    And anyone out there reading this, don't hold me responsible if you buy a 77mm filter on my advice and it doesn't fit your lens!

  content: Filter sizes should not be a problem.  Figure out what the largest size
    in your kit is (in my case, it's 77mm) and then buy step-up rings for any lenses
    that use a smaller size.  Step-up rings are cheap and keep you from having to
    buy the same filters for different lens sizes.

![B&W ND
Filter](http://singleservingphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/bw-filter-150x103.jpg "B&W ND Filter")

Have you heard of the fabled "neutral density" filter before? Whether or
not you know what one is, I'm about to blow the lid off this mysterious
piece of kit, totally demystify the nineteen (well, four...) ways their
strengths are measured, and give you some awesome tips for using them
effectively in the field.

Starting from the top, what exactly is an ND filter, anyway?<span
id="more"></span><span id="more-454"></span>

## What Exactly Is an ND Filter, Anyway?

ND stands for "neutral density." "Density" refers to _optical density_
or _absorbance_. The absorbance of a substance is basically the amount
of light it will absorb as opposed to the amount that will pass through
it. By "neutral" we mean that the absorbance of the filter is the same
across all wavelengths of light.

To put it in simpler terms, ND filters only _transmit_ some fraction
of the light that hits them, and when the light comes out the other side
the colors should be completely unaffected. Okay, so that's great, but
why do we care?

As you may recall from reading [Mastering the Only Five Camera
Settings,](http://singleservingphoto.com/2008/06/30/mastering-the-only-five-camera-settings/)
there is only so much you can do to change the characteristics of the
scene you're capturing.

When I wrote that article, I wasn't making stuff up; those five settings
are really the only ones. By adding an ND filter into the mix, however,
you add another variable you can control. We love control, don't we?

In effect, adding an ND filter is most similar to reducing your ISO
sensitivity, which may be the only way to get slower shutter speeds in
situations where light is ample and your ISO is already as low as it can
go. So then the next question is, why do you want slower shutter speeds?

## Why Do You Want Slower Shutter Speeds?

[![Bridal Veil Falls, near Index,
Washington](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/38/81303741_1aa4cf6e6e_m.jpg "Bridal Veil Falls")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/skycaptaintwo/81303741/)

The most often cited reason is to get the "veiling effect" that water
produces during a longer exposure. Normally, you might have to go out
just after dawn or wait until dusk before the conditions would be right
to make a several-second exposure of a natural waterfall.

Check out the awesome photo on the right from
[skycaptaintwo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/skycaptaintwo/). Without an
ND filter it could be challenging to get the low-light situation that
would make that photo possible. Now, I don't know for sure that this
photographer used an ND filter, but the image is a great example of
where having one might definitely come in handy.

There are three main reasons for using an ND filter that I know of (but
I'm sure you can think of more):

\# To get a "veiling effect" when photographing water (this works for
waterfalls as well as the water's moving surface, e.g. the ocean,
lakes)\
 \# To capture a sense of movement by adding motion blur (e.g. when
people are walking around, cars driving by, and so on)\
 \# To get an increased depth of field (more background blur, or
"bokeh") when light is ample

The first two require slower shutter speeds, the last requires a larger
aperture opening. All three necessarily require that more light enter
the camera, which is why you may need to use an ND filter to reduce the
amount of light that enters in order to keep your exposure correct.

Swell. Now we know all about what ND filters are for. But how do you
size them up? ND filter specifications can be pretty confusing. That's
why I will explain ND filter specifications to you now.

## ND Filter Specifications, Explained

There are four measures that can be used to describe how much light an
ND filter blocks and/or transmits, and they are:

\# Attenuation factor (or "filter factor")\
 \# Optical density (or "grade")\
 \# F-stop equivalence\
 \# Percent transmittance

Only two of the above are regularly used to describe filters when you're
buying them (grade and density), but it can be helpful to know the
others to get a better idea of what it all means. Some sites, like B&H,
may also list the remaining stats in the "specifications" tab for each
product, though the product title itself will only contain one of the
four measurements.

|*Filter Factor*|*Optical Density*|*F-Stop
Equiv.*|*Transmittance*|\
 |2|0.3|1|50%|\
 |4|0.6|2|25%|\
 |8|0.9|3|12.5%|\
 |16|1.2|4|6.25%|\
 |32|1.5|5|3.125%|\
 |64|1.8|6|1.5625%|\
 |1,000|3.0|10|0.1%|

The filter factor or attenuation factor is used often when labeling a
filter product. Generally it's written as "ND8" or "ND64." The optical
density or grade is also commonly used, and will always appear as a
decimal number, "0.3" or "3.0" and so on. Just to be completely clear, a
filter labeled ND1000 *is equivalent* to a filter labeled ND 3.0. They
are exactly the same.

Now, technically, filters above a 1,000 grade exist. You aren't going to
see them around too often, and I'll tell you one reason why. With an
ND1000, or ND 3.0 filter, you're blocking out 10 stops of light, which
means you're only receiving 0.1% of the total light in the scene. The
ND1000 filter looks like a disk of black glass; you can barely see
through it with your naked eyes. When using an ND1000 filter, you have
to compose and focus your scene on a tripod and _then_ screw on the
filter, because once it's on you won't be able to see anything at all,
unless you're pointing directly at the sun... And why would you do that?

## Let's Talk Brands

Filters made by B+W are among the best quality you can buy; the the
materials used and the fit and finish are top notch. An ND1000 filter
from B+W can run \$100 or more.

If you are a Canon "L" or Nikon "Nikkor" shooter, you require a 77mm
diameter filter. Here are some nice ones made by B+W from my favorite
store, B&H:

* [B+W ND 0.3,
\$49](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/7982-REG/B_W_65072718_77mm_x_0_75_101.html?KBID=2457&BI=1816)
(same as ND2, 1 f-stop)\
 * [B+W ND 0.6,
\$49](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/8018-REG/B_W_65_072910_77mm_102_Neutral_Density.html?KBID=2457&BI=1816)
(same as ND4, 2 f-stops)\
 * [B+W ND 0.9,
\$94](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/8054-REG/B_W_65_073102_77mm_103_Neutral_Density.html?KBID=2457&BI=1816)
(same as ND8, 4 f-stops)\
 * [B+W ND 3.0,
\$97](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/8120-REG/B_W_65_066729_77mm_110_Neutral_Density.html?KBID=2457&BI=1816)
(same as ND1000, 10 f-stops)

You will find the biggest selection of filters from B+W and Tiffen.
Tiffen makes reasonably priced and solidly performing glass filters. You
may also want to look at Cokin or Heliopan.

One thing to note when shopping for filters is that a brand like B+W
offers each of their ND filters with a variety of options such as a
multi-coated surface to reduce flares and ghosting, or in a slim form
factor for better performance on wide-angle lenses. Prices vary
depending upon the options.

## Let's Talk... Brands... Again

An important thing to think about when you're looking at adding filters
to your kit is the combination of different brands of threaded filters.
Although filter threading is standardized, you can sometimes run into
trouble when you screw a B+W ND filter onto the front of a Canon UV
filter, and so on. Mixing and matching brands is somewhat discouraged.

If you don't use UV filters (a subject for another post entirely), or if
you don't intend to stack effect filters, then buy whatever brands fit
your needs and budget.

Happy filtering!
