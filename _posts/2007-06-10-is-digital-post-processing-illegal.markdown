  content: "Well, Aaron. A very well done article and one that has peeked my interest
    with regard to the art considerations of your quest for placement in the world
    of photography/art for the digital expression of images.  Overall I might agree
    with your analysis however, I think  a few other thoughts might be brought into
    your arguement. \r\n\r\nFirstly, to anwer your title question: \"Is Digital Post-Processing
    Illegal\"? . I would have to anwer most certainly \"No\".  Digital photography
    along with the all of the digital enhancments provided by Photoshop is a new photographic
    as well as artistic medium. It can be compared to traditional methods but perhaps
    \ not meant to be forced into the same traditional meaning of photography. \r\n\r\nThe
    distinction between taking photographs and taking artistic photographs should
    be addressed. You stated in your article that \"digital photography had completed
    the transformation of post-processing into an art form itself...\". An art form
    perhaps, but only art if handled by an artist. Painting is an art form, but not
    all who paint are artists. What modern post-processing has done to and for the
    photographer is to make techniques easier and  instant, which can mesmerize a
    novice into thinking that they are creating art and/or a competent photograph.
    \r\n\r\nThis distinction, in my opinion, is more the question than whether or
    not it is legal.  For example: Is digital animation as artistic as the hand drawn
    ways of the past? In many ways, it is not. Much aestheticism is lost. Perhaps
    an aesthetic issue should be part of your concern between the old and the new?
    What do you think? The newer technologies are less hands-on and more virtual.
    Not bad, but certainly different and requiring one's involvement to be less intrinsically
    personal. More emphasis is placed on the product than the process...a long debated
    art theme!!! \r\n\r\nI don't think that when \" a photograph passes into a different
    state of being and loses its status as a photograph\"  it is \"purely semantic\"!!
    If a photo loses its status or its integrity as a photograph in the artistic sense,
    then it had better get itself another name! And, THAT is the crux of this entire
    debate....in my humble opinion. "

    The biggest sticking point in my mind regarding photographs that have been heavily edited in Photoshop et al. is simply how much editing a photograph can withstand before it must "get itself another name." The debates that I have witnessed and participated in seem to gain momentum until they get to that point and then they stall; everyone's idea of what a "photograph" is seems to differ.

    The main point that I hope my article got across is that editing such as dodging, burning, hand-coloring negatives, and other "traditional" techniques produced work that was unquestionably accepted as "photographic." Nowadays, the same effects are possible using Photoshop, et al., and those results tend to be accepted as "photographic," but a few steps further down the editing pipeline, suddenly people are up-in-arms, decrying these prints as "digital media," etc.

    What is fascinating to me is that traditional darkroom techniques developed over years and years, offering more and more flexibility, and never was the final product's status as a photograph questioned. Suddenly, digital is changing the way we look at photographically-derived work. Changing the way we evaluate it.

  content: "Firstly I wanted to say thankyou for an interesting read and a well written
    article.  All too often we get so tied up in our debates that few people take
    the time to add some hard facts and a bit of history into their arguement.\r\n\r\nReturning
    to the debate, I think you and Shae have hit the nail on the head as to what the
    issue is here.  \r\n\r\nThe problem is whether or not a photograph loses it's
    status as a photograph after a certain amount of editting.\r\nIf it does lose
    it's status, at what point can we define that as having occured.\r\n\r\nI have
    tried to approach this from a logical point of view rather than an emotional one
    (as I am definately a photoshop junkie and as such can't help but resent suggestions
    that my images are any less worthy than another persons').\r\n\r\nWith my logical
    head on I first considdered the term photograph.  As a 'photograph' refers only
    to a singular item (image), with a number of images being refered to with the
    plural 'photographs' my first thought was:\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the individual
    uses more than one image in a composite the image is no longer 'a' photograph\".\r\n\r\nThe
    problem arose when I tried to compare the analogy to automobiles.  If you take
    two cars and cut them in half, then weld the front of one car to the rear of the
    other, you still end up with 'a car'  (albeit one you wouldn't want to buy second-hand)!\r\n\r\nThis
    led me to the conclusion that all artwork which involves photographic capture
    is 'a photograph'.  The best way to manage the field would be to add a suffix
    to the title such as the following:\r\n\r\nPhotograph - Historic Record\r\nNo
    post processing other then brightness, contrast and white balance and all with
    the aim of reproducing reality.\r\nIn addition the original image captured by
    the camera must not mis-represent reality.\r\n\r\nPhotograph - Artistic\r\nA single
    image which has been taken and manipulated to produce a result which pleases the
    photographer (&amp;/or client).\r\n\r\nPhotograph - Composite\r\nAn image composed
    of a number of images and manipulated to produce a result which pleases the photographer
    (&amp;/or client).\r\n\r\nOf course the problem this presents is that having defined
    a new set of guidelines we have a whole new set of ambiguities.  For example a
    war correspondent who takes a photo which compresses distances.  He may have chosen
    his equipment in order to do this as it best represented the feeling of danger
    which he was experiencing.  He has still followed the guidelines to portray reality
    but everyones percetion is different."

    Thanks, John, I'm glad you liked the article. Your reply is thorough and brings up some additional food for thought.

    How would you classify a photograph created by compositing two separate exposures of the same scene? For example, HDR, or more classically the "Orton effect?" Is that still a photograph?

    My friends and relatives have called me pedantic in the past, but in this case, I tend toward the position that any photographically derived image should be classified as a photograph unless someone can come up with a very convincing argument to the contrary. I agree with you that there is a huge chasm dividing archival, documentary, and forensic photography from artistic and aesthetic photography, but I am mostly concerned with the latter. It goes without saying that even a small touch from Photoshop can discredit forensic photographic work, which is why they make those encrypted media cards and so on.

    I think that correspondents and photojournalists labor under an entirely different set of expectations and definitions, and although some of their work is highly artistic, it is what it is; a documentary photograph. My fundamental point is that an artist should be driven by their own process and their own desired outcomes and not by definitions and semantics.

    Thanks again for participating.

    I chose to change the photo aside from sharpening and slight color issues like
    they do in most modern labs with 3rd party filters, HDR, etc then I call it PhotoArt.  It
    may be too simplistic for most people but it cuts down on the amount of headaches
    I suffer worrying about it.

\$random:right\$

There was a time, long ago, when photographs were conceived at the
moment the shutter button was depressed. Darkroom techniques were
limited at best (the idea that a photographic image could even be
created was a modern miracle) and the photographer was required to make
near-perfect exposures every time.

Things have changed a lot since then; it's now possible to do amazing
things long after the light has been captured by the camera. Today I'm
going to explore some competing points of view and take a philosophical
walk through the annals of photographic history to clear up some
improper perceptions of digital post-processing.<span
id="more"></span><span id="more-124"></span>

h2. First, Some History

The first commercially viable photographic technology was the
[Daguerrotype](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daguerrotype), a
positive-only process (no negative is created and each image can only be
made once) resulting in extremely fragile prints on copper plates.

Not only was the development and printing process inflexible and time
consuming, but it also exposed photographers to chemicals such as
mercury and iodine; not the kinds of things you want to be _boiling_
and possibly _inhaling_!

\$random:left\$

Over time, photographic technology evolved. The system of using silver
halide-based negatives emerged, allowing photographers to make more than
one print from each of their images; prints that could be handled
without fear of destroying them. The printing process itself was
transformed from a cumbersome operation using metal substrates and
boiling chemicals to the more refined and less hazardous procedure we
use today.

It was the invention of the glass negative (circa 1839, possibly by John
Herschel, an astronomer by trade (Edit: It was brought to my attention that
Herschel wasn't responsible for the "invention" of the negative, although he
probably coined the term. For more information about this stage in photography's
early development, read about
[William Fox Talbot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Fox_Talbot),
[John Herschel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Herschel), and the
[wet plate collodion process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collodion)) that
precipitated the institution of photographic post-processing. The negative
expanded the photographic process into three steps, which should look very
familiar:

\# Exposure\
 \# Development\
 \# Printing

\$random:right\$

Post-processing, by definition, is altering the image *after* the
light has been captured (hence, _post-_). Traditionally, these
alterations were achieved by modifying the way the exposed film was
developed into a negative and the way the negative was printed. For the
first time, photographers had the ability to enhance their images beyond
the capacity of the film materials of the day; dodging and burning, for
example, can create images with a tonal range beyond what can be
captured by the film at exposure time.

As photographic technology and techniques surge forward, the
photographer is given a progressively more expansive collection of
post-processing tools and abilities. Digital photography has completed
the transformation of post-processing into an art form unto itself,
based concretely on captured-light imagery but possessing all of the
characteristics and nuances of a full-fledged medium. Regardless of its
flexibility and capabilities, is it not still bound to photography?

bq. "While I have always worked with fairly conventional means and
techniques, I anticipate new departures which, if I cannot examine them
in my lifetime, will assure the power of future vision and
accomplishment." --Ansel Adams, Carmel, 1976

h2. Artistic Integrity

\$random:left\$

Any debate over whether post-processing invalidates the artistic
integrity of a photographic work is fundamentally academic. Even before
chemical photography existed, artists used camera-like devices such as
the _camera obscura_ or optical contraptions like the _camera
lucida_ to trace a three-dimensional scene onto paper. Chemical
photography and highly sensitive film materials simply permitted artists
to capture their subjects faster and with greater accuracy, but never
excused an artist from laying hands upon the entire process to reach
their artistic goals. Never in the evolution of darkroom techniques was
the final product's status as a photograph questioned.

A perception exists that the medium of captured-light images is pure,
not to be spoiled by the meddling of non-optical tools. It may be that
the last few decades of photography, during which no paradigm shifts in
traditional process have occurred ((Digital photography is
unquestionably a paradigm shift, but the idea of collecting light
through a lens, capturing the resulting image, and reproducing that
image on paper is exactly the same as it was when the term "photography"
was first conceived in 1832.)), are responsible for this notion. Or, it
may be that the digital world is so vastly different--not in essence,
but in physicality--from the world of the darkroom that this discussion
has arisen.

\$random:right\$

Still, there are those who perceive an imaginary line in post-processing
across which a photograph passes into a different state of being and
loses its status as a photograph. To me, this distinction is purely
semantic. We could debate the definition of "photograph" _ad
infinitum_ and never reach a consensus. What does this discussion do
for any of us as artists?

Far be it from me to make sweeping generalizations about a field as
personal and subjective as art, but I feel as though the detractors of
post-processing are the antithesis of its very spirit. Let me explain.

h2. The Question of Intent

You could say that a watercolor splattered with acrylic ceases to be a
watercolor. Semantically, that's true enough; I think that the world of
art would classify such a painting as "mixed media." Perhaps the
stumbling block in digital photography is the inextricable relationship
between its traditional light-capture methods and the digital
"development" tools that make even its most modest creations possible.

\$random:left\$

Because traditional darkroom development tools have always been part and
parcel to the process we call "photography," even since the earliest
days of its existence, it's hard to suggest that they are separate
mediums or separate forms of art. I contend that digital photography is
no different. A digital photographer may not use chemical developers or
optical enlargers, but the process is fundamentally the same. Those who
claim otherwise tend to draw the line at a subjective point in the
editing process, one which marks no meaningful boundary.

Rather than introducing entirely new mechanics or technology, digital
post-processing of any degree makes use of the same fundamental
operations that produce simple and austere works. Because the tools are
the same, it is the methods themselves, the intricacies of the artist's
process, that are called into question; something that has never
happened in photography before, certainly not to this degree.

What do you think? Are there Photoshop filters or third-party software
tools or certain editing techniques that transform a photograph into a
photographically-derived work, not deserving of the name "photograph?"
Where do you draw the line?

*I think that it's an artist's duty to carefully examine each viewpoint
in this discussion and then promptly ignore them all.*
