<p>on the weekends i while away the hours working in a flower shop. it is located in a busy collection of odd/hip stores coexisting in one building; all hardwood floors and old woodwork. there is a toy store next door to the florist where i plunk myself. frequently i hear tantrums, followed by a parent carrying a kicking, screeching child down the hallway and outside. but, when the children are running this way (in the photo) they are just jonesin' to get to the store. i see little blurs run by all the time. chased by slightly more exasperated, older, less blurry parents.</p>
