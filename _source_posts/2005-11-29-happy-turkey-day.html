<p>I got sick over my Thanksgiving break, which is a great reminder that even national holidays are not recognized by most viruses. In fact&mdash;and I have this on good authority&mdash;most viruses don't even speak English.</p>
<p>It's been hard for me to come up with any new work, as I've been putting a lot of time into the <a href="http://www.thebailiwick.com/boxdoodles/">boxdoodles</a> initiative. I hope everyone here can get something out of that.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of shots from Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>That is a fake Christmas tree. Inauthentic. Faux. Imitation. Artificial. Simulated. Still pretty.</p>
