<p>Dennis Calvert shares a really neat light painting technique on his blog that he calls "Man on Fire." It basically involves creating a darkened silhouette by firing a remote flash behind a subject to overexpose the background behind them, and then "painting" in the silhouetted area with some neat little light wands.</p>
<p>I'm sure you could do this with subjects other than people and with light wands other than the ones Dennis uses. The result, I think, is pretty spectacular. Because the background is blown out, bits of light trail that go outside of the silhouette area become wispy and look very cool.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, the image is straight out of the camera, no post-processing or alterations at all.</p>
<p>Go check out the whole article "on Dennis's blog":http://denniscalvert.net/blog/?p=118#comment-16 where you will also find a time-lapse video of the making of the image, which is pretty neat in its own right.</p>
