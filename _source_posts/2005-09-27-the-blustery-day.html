<p>i'm sort of cheating since i took this when i went hiking two days ago. but it was such an amazing day. so windy and raw and blandly grey. it made everything look so different. i'd hiked this trail so many times this summer and it took on a whole new meaning. i finally explored the old summit house (formerly a posh hotel during the turn of the century) poked into creepy musty rooms and hung out on a 10 foot observation deck at the tippy-top (complete with wind-slamming, creaky doors) it felt very movie-scene to me.</p>
