<p>I received another e-mail from the (former) Editor in Chief of JPG Magazine yesterday announcing that JPG isn't quite dead. Here is the full message:</p>
<blockquote><p>We couldn't ask for a better community. In the week or so since our last email, the outpour of support has exceeded our wildest expectations. Your efforts, such as starting savejpg.com, writing blog posts, commenting on Twitter and Flickr, and generally making your voices heard, have provided exciting new opportunities for us.</p>
<p>We're thrilled to say that because of you, we have multiple credible buyers interested in giving JPG a home. We will be keeping the site up after all, and hope to have a final update in the next week or so on who the acquirer will be. Thank you for making all of this possible.</p>
<p>Laura Brunow Miner<br />
Editor in Chief</p></blockquote>
