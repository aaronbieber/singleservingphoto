<p>Our workshop has yet to officially begin, but that doesn't stop "us":http://artphotoworkshops.com/pages/view/Biographies from getting up well before dawn and catching a taxi down to Navy Pier to get some shooting in.

<p>Here are my favorite shots from this morning. Off to a good start, I would say!</p>
<p>The Ferris wheel at Navy Pier is one of its most remarkable features. Here, it is reflected in the shallow pool surrounding the (currently closed) Wave Swing.</p>

<p>More after the jump!<a id="more"></a><a id="more-188"></a></p>
<p>This bench near the Wave Swing is surrounded by roses. Pretty, no?</p>

<p>A sculptural anchor stands at the tip of Navy Pier, which was named in honor of its service to the Navy during World War II. Previously it had been known simply as Municipal Pier #2.</p>

<p>This switchback walkway caught my eye with its angles and contrasts.</p>

<p>Finally, a cityscape is hovered over in the dawn hours by a nearly full moon.</p>
