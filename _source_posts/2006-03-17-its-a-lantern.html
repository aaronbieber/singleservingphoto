<p>sort of uninspired lately. here's a lantern thing and a tree that i found. it's still frighteningly chilly out there.  my photography skills freeze up during winter, becoming dull molasses. also, one cannot wear a jacket made of jean and not chatter during march in mass., this i learned today.</p>
