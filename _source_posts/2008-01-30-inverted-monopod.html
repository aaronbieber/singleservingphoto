<p>This sweet video from someone called "cobbler" on "Metacafe":http://www.metacafe.com shows you how to make a rather ingenious _image stabilizer_, which I have decided to call an "inverted monopod."</p>
<p>I won't ruin the surprise, nor will I keep you from the video, which is right here:</p>

<p>(View the original video "on Metacafe":http://www.metacafe.com/watch/1041948/1_image_stabilizer_for_any_camera_lose_the_tripod/)</p>
<p>Personally, I think this idea is brilliant and I give a tip of my cap to "cobbler," whoever and wherever they may be.</p>
