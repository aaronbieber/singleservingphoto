<p>Remember when I "told you about":http://singleservingphoto.com/2010/04/21/burrard-lucases-and-the-beetlecam/ that crazy remote-controlled robot carting a DSLR that these two British brothers would drive around Africa, taking up-close-and-personal photos of wild animals? It was called the BeetleCam, and it was the brainchild of William and Matthew Burrard-Lucas, two swiftly burgeoning wildlife photographers from the UK.</p>
<p>Well, _they're at it again_, only this time they're not using a remote-controlled dune buggy and they're not photographing lions or elephants. They're using an _ingenious_ tabletop lighting setup and capturing the births of _mosquito larvae_.</p>
<p>See all of the amazing macro photos and read about the brothers' technical process on their guest post on Digital Photography School!</p>
