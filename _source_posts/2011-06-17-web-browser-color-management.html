<p>I've written articles in the past about color management--you know, ICC profiles, calibration, metamerism, blah blah blah--but the world keeps changing around us. In general, things change for the better, which is great, but as a photographer looking to display images on the web, there are always things to watch out for.</p>
<p>I found a great article on the burgeoning "Gear Oracle" site about web browser color management, which breaks down the effects of displaying images with different color spaces in different browsers.</p>
<p>It's not all great news, but it's important to know how things work so that you can mitigate any potential problems. Color management is basically a briar patch no matter how attentive and diligent you are, and trust me, I know this from close personal experience printing photographic reproductions for five years.</p>
