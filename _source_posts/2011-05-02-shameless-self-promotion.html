<p>I know it's been a super long time since I've posted, but I assure you that it wasn't anything _you_ did. Perhaps it sounds like a lame excuse but as much as I enjoy sharing photography news, tips, and ideas with all of you, this blog is just a hobby and life has a way of encroaching on hobbies sometimes.</p>
<p>That having been said, and in the theme of "shameless self-promotion," I would like to (very, very happily) announce that I finally posted my photos from both the Grand Teton National Park as well as Yellowstone National Park; a trip that I took nearly a whole year ago. I hemmed and hawed over which photographs to use and how to process them for an enormous amount of time.</p>
<p>Here's one of my favorites from the Grand Prismatic Spring boardwalk at Yellowstone:</p>
<p><object width="600" height="418"><param name="movie" value="http://www.photoshelter.com/swf/imgWidget.swf"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="FlashVars" value="i=I0000ZjPMZYZkTlM&b=0"></param><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.photoshelter.com/swf/imgWidget.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowScriptAccess="true" FlashVars="i=I0000ZjPMZYZkTlM&b=0" allowfullscreen="true" width="600" height="418"></embed></object></p>
<p>Because I am eternally grateful to you, my gentle readers, my loyal audience, for sticking around through months of crappy news posts and half-hearted "copy pasta" articles, I would like to offer all of you guys a *special secret discount on all of my prints for the entire month*.</p>
<p>If you visit "my Yellowstone gallery":http://aaronbieber.photoshelter.com/gallery/Yellowstone-NP-Wyoming/G0000FguDlRBESYc/P0000jNQBakpYdwI or "my Grand Teton gallery":http://aaronbieber.photoshelter.com/gallery/Grand-Teton-NP-Wyoming/G0000lnL3Z9qOjS4/P0000jNQBakpYdwI or "my main site":http://gallery.aaronbieber.com/gallery-list and you use the "add to cart" link to purchase image downloads or prints of *any photo* you can use the coupon code "SSP-MAY" to get *25% off your order* for the entire month.</p>
<p>Here's my favorite image from the Grand Tetons, taken at Jenny Lake:</p>
<p><object width="600" height="418"><param name="movie" value="http://www.photoshelter.com/swf/imgWidget.swf"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="FlashVars" value="i=I0000ul0o4lTVVBA&b=0"></param><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.photoshelter.com/swf/imgWidget.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowScriptAccess="true" FlashVars="i=I0000ul0o4lTVVBA&b=0" allowfullscreen="true" width="600" height="418"></embed></object></p>
<p>You can use this coupon code as many times as you want on any images you want. Photographic prints are prepared and shipped by ExposureManager, digital downloads are available immediately (have them printed by the shop of your choice if you like).</p>
<p>The coupon code again is "SSP-MAY" and you can "start browsing my gallery right here":http://gallery.aaronbieber.com/gallery-list.</p>
