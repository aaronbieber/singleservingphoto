<p>On the path to creativity, it's not only _okay_ to stop and smell the roses, it's _encouraged_.</p>
<p>My approach to inspiration is not to chase it; I tend to walk around in a place or idly browse others' works until the desire to create something strikes. Still, it's nice to have a "toolbox" of tricks to get you past those creative lulls in life. According to psychologist Jonathan Schooler (no, really, that's his actual name), daydreaming is one possible answer.</p>
<p>Well, if you know you're doing it, that is.</p>
<p>From Boston.com (Jonah Lehrer):</p>
<blockquote><p>"If your mind didn't wander, then you'd be largely shackled to whatever you are doing right now," says Jonathan Schooler, a psychologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. "But instead you can engage in mental time travel and other kinds of simulation. During a daydream, your thoughts are really unbounded."</p></blockquote>
<p>And who wouldn't want to _time travel_? The key, though, is self-awareness of your wandering mind. The study concluded that people who were able to recognize when they were daydreaming demonstrated more of a predilection to creativity than those who were only able to identify their daydreams _after_ they happened.</p>
<p>When I read this story I began thinking about my own daydreaming habits. I think I can say with certainty that I absolutely know when I'm daydreaming... Because I love it. There's nothing like taking a little break from reality now and then!</p>
<p>Despite photography's firm basis in reality&mdash;capturing real light reflecting off of real objects&mdash;it is in so many ways an _escape_ from reality, and an art form that can benefit from your daydreams just as much as any other.</p>
<p>So the next time you find yourself staring off into the distance and traveling mentally through time and space, don't pull yourself back down to Earth so quickly.</p>
