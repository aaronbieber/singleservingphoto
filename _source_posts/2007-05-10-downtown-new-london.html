<p>I admit it. I've been holding out on you. Let me just say, with all of my heart, I am sorry.</p>
<p>I went shooting for a while after work today and it got me to thinking about this whole collection of downtown New London photos that I've never posted anywhere. So, I spent a bit of time in Lightroom getting them sorted out, and now, without further ado, here they are. Okay, well, four of them anyway.</p>
<p>These were taken on the Amtrak Excela tracks that run along the pier. I can hear the train whistle basically all day, which would be great if it wasn't tremendously irritating.</p>

<p>I see this fellow on many mornings when I walk to work. He always stops and steps out of the way so that I can pass him on the sidewalk. I'm not sure if everyone is home upstairs, but he's a charming man. He has good taste in waterfowl, too.<br />
