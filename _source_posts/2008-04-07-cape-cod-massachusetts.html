<p>I took the day off on Friday and went up to Cape Cod for the weekend to see what all the fuss is about. Though I was born and raised here in New England, for some reason I never visited and this seemed like the proper time to correct that.</p>
<p>The weather wasn't exactly perfect, but when it stopped raining the overcast skies provided a very soft and round light that made everything glow.</p>
<p>Here is one that I think sums up the place and the experience, but please do "view the rest of the gallery":http://fisheyegallery.com/Places/CapeCod for more!</p>
