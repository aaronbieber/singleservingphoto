<p>Well, here it is, folks. As reported by "Digital Photography Review":http://www.dpreview.com/news/0910/09102001canon1d4.asp, "Rob Galbraith DPI":http://www.robgalbraith.com/bins/multi_page.asp?cid=7-10044-10310, "Engadget":http://www.engadget.com/2009/10/20/canon-eos-1d-mark-iv-announced-16-1-megapixels-45-point-autofo/, and undoubtedly more, Canon has officially released the EOS-1D Mark IV, the latest digital SLR in their 1-series (â€œproâ€) line.</p>
<p><img src="http://singleservingphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/canon-eos-mark-iv-press-rm-eng1-287x300.jpg" alt="EOS-1D Mark IV" title="EOS-1D Mark IV" width="287" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-387" style="float: right; margin: 10px 0 10px 15px;" /></p>
<p>I find it somewhat amusing that they chose to throw on the EF 50mm f/1.4 for their promo shoot; a lens that, for me, spontaneously stopped auto-focusing after only a couple years of use and that exhibits pretty significant vignetting. Nevertheless, the EOS-1D Mark IV is a fairly intense camera body, with its 10 frame per second burst mode, and ISO settings up to 102,400. You should be able to lay your hands on one here in the States for a mere $4,999.</p>
<p>Personally, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be purchasing a 1D Mark IV, if only because it has an APS-H sensor with a 1.3x crop factor and I am utterly spoiled by my 5Dâ€™s full-frame sensor. It is worth noting, also, that for the $4,999 that a brand new 1D Mark IV is going to cost you, you can pretty readily find a pre-owned 1Ds Mark III, which is 21 megapixels of full-frame goodness.</p>
