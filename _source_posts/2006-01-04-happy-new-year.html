<p>So it's 2006 already. In a way it seems as though 2005 went by very quickly. At the same time, <em>so much</em> happened. I got carried away and forgot to post!</p>
<p>Here are just a couple of things. First, a picture I took for a friend of mine as a Christmas present for a different friend. I did a tremendous amount of Photoshop post-processing work on this. He loved it.<br />
