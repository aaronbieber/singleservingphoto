<p>Since last post I have moved to the great mysterious northern realm of New Hampshire. A land of tail-gating drivers and no sales tax; of state-run liquor stores  and a severe lack of decent movie theatres. Apparently, all I have to show from the last five months of my life are photos of a fuzzy little troublemaker named Renton (sleeping is the only time he is not destroying something) and the view from the cracked windowpane of an apartment window. I live in a very old and tilty Victorian house. Since I hate the frigid weather (sweet idea moving north, what the heck was I thinking?) this photo was taken from the relative warmth of my living room.  Pardon me while I hibernate the next few months away.</p>
