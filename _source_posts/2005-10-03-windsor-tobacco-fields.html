<p>Here in Windsor where I work, we are surrounded on almost all sides by vast tobacco fields. They were even once host to the filming of the 1961 film "Parrish":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0055279. This morning was incredibly foggy, and I had no choice but to take some time out to capture these.</p>
