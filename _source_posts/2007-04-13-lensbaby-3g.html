<p>Today I received my brand new <a href="http://www.lensbabies.com/" target="_blank">Lensbaby</a> 3G from <a href="http://www.bhphoto.com/" target="_blank">B&amp;H</a>. I've been looking forward to buying one of these ever since the first version came out, but I'm very glad that I waited for the third iteration because the new features it has are (in my mind) indispensable.</p>
<p>I set up a very small tabletop studio rig yesterday, so I used it to explore the Lensbaby and see what it could do. It's really a very nice piece of equipment with solid build quality, but make no mistake: it's <em>not easy</em> to use. Having no functional autofocus means paying a lot more attention to the perceived focus and the way the bellows is manipulated takes getting used to. People without a fair amount of dexterity may become very frustrated with it.</p>
<p>Anyway, without further ado, here are a few samples.</p>
