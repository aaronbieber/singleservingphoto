<p>I picked up and I moved to New London, CT, <em>The Whaling City</em>. I can't say that I'm a huge fan of fishing and whaling, but I am a huge fan of the waterfront. I finally got a chance to take my camera out and walk along the pier by the train station last night and I want to share these with you all.</p>
<p>In front of the police substation, overlooking the main fishing dock.<br />

<p>Various impressive waterfront industrial complexes across the river.<br />

<p>My favorite of the three, my experiments with long exposure facing another fishing pier.<br />
