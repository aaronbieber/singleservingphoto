<p>Again, I've been withholding! I'm so very sorry. In late March I took a day trip to the Roger Williams Park and Zoo in Rhode Island to see what all the fuss was about. Actually, it was the last weekend before the price went up for "peak zoo season," so it seemed like a good diversion.</p>
<p>I shot with the Canon 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L IS nearly the entire time. It was challenging to get good exposures in some of the buildings at 400mm, but the 5D produces such pleasing and acceptable noise even at ISO 1600, it wasn't a total loss. I plan to do an article comparing the noise between the 5D and much older 10D, but for now just enjoy these crazy animal photos.</p>

<p>I may post more from this set later on; I'm still combing through them. You may also notice that my photos are now linked over to my actual gallery. This allows me to keep all of my stuff more organized and it also allows you to purchase prints of the ones you like without having to e-mail me about it (although I would still love to hear from you if you have anything on your mind.)</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
