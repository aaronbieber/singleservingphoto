<p>You remember the National Association of Photoshop Professionals? NAPP? Their president, Scott Kelby, is like _the_ Photoshop guy, he teaches Photoshop and Lightroom and travels all around the world doing seminars and evangelizing for Adobe (in an indirect way, as a representative of over 30,000 people who use Photoshop professionally). He's as close to a Photoshop guru as you can realistically get before you become Thomas Knoll or Russell Brown.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to say here is that you really couldn't learn Photoshop (or Lightroom) from any better folks than Scott Kelby and his Photoshop crew (Corey Barker, Pete Collins, RC Concepcion, and of course Matt Kloskowski). Normally this type of instruction costs a few bucks or at least a trip somewhere. But not this week.</p>
<p>This week only, presented in a live format, Scott and his crew (he calls them "The Photoshop Guys") are doing a series of retouching presentations that you can watch for free. This starts tonight at 6 PM EST. The presentations are, in order:</p>
<p>* Wedding Retouching (tonight, Dec. 5)<br />
* Digital Makeup (Dec. 6)<br />
* The Next Level of Retouching (Dec. 7)<br />
* LIVE Show - Audience Participation in Q&A (Dec. 8)<br />
* Tips from the Industry (Dec. 9)</p>
<p>My understanding is that the fourth presentation is the only time that The Photoshop Guys will take any questions directly from the digital audience, but all five presentations will be streamed live.</p>
<p>To tune in, just visit "Retouching Week on Photoshop User":www.photoshopuser.com/retouching-week. It looks like the video and chat feeds are having some problems at the moment, but since the event has not yet started I'm sure the IT screw at Photoshop User will be able to work out all the bugs before it gets underway tonight at 6.</p>
<p>I don't know about you guys but I'll be tuned in!</p>
