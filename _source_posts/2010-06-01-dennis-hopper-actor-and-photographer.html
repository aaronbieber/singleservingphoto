<p>As I'm sure you've heard, Dennis Hopper passed away just days ago (the 29th of May, 2010). As an actor, I personally loved his roles in such classics as _Super Mario Bros._, _Waterworld_, and _Speed_, though he is best known for _Easy Rider_, _Rebel Without a Cause_, _Cool Hand Luke_, and more. He certainly had a knack for the dramatic, but what I didn't know was that he also had a knack for photography.</p>
<p>The "Chasing Light" blog has a "wonderful post":http://blog.ricecracker.net/2010/05/31/dennis-hopper-1936-2010/ containing photos that Hopper took through the years (all of them black and white). I was very impressed with them; they show attention to composition and subject comparable to those of a seasoned professional or serious hobbyist. You could certainly call Hopper a serious hobbyist, though he was more widely known for his feature films than for his "photography, painting, and sculpture":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hopper#Photography_and_art.</p>
<p>Over at artnet, you can view (and attempt to purchase) "39 other photographs by Hopper":http://www.artnet.com/Artists/ArtistHomePage.aspx?artist_id=8500&page_tab=Artworks_for_sale that are held by various galleries.</p>
<p>Whether you are into Hopper's photographs or not, let's take a moment to remember a great actor and inspirational creator.</p>
