<p>The best thing about shooting in RAW is that you can "develop" the file to adjust exposure, white balance, and scores of other settings without losing much image detail. I've seen people do some pretty cool stuff with that ability, but those people don't have an equally cool name, like _Calvin Hollywood_.</p>
<p>Calvin Hollywood--and yes, that's his real name--is a prolific photographer and digital darkroom master from Heidelberg, Germany. Maybe you've heard of him, but I hadn't until this morning when I ran across this tutorial he made about "double RAW conversion" wherein he loads the same RAW file processed in two different ways into Photoshop to boost image detail.</p>
<p>Now, this style might not be your particular cup of tea (or stein of beer, to put a German twist on it), but check out the video below, I think it's pretty cool!</p>
