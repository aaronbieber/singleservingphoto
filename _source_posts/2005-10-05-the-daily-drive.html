<p>Prior to driving to work this morning I caught a glimpse of some of this typically bacheloresque trash laying about and making a graphic composition of itself. You get down with your bad self, Rolling Rock. You _get down_.</p>

<p>As I was driving in I endangered many lives to capture this and several other _shifting one-handed and photographing out the window_ shots.</p>

<p>Then I parked and this just *happened*.</p>

<p>I can't complain.</p>
