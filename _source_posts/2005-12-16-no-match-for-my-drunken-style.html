<p>It's been a while since I've posted. I apologize to you all. While enjoying an evening of Jackie Chan's Drunken Master (1978), I was able to snap a couple of photos before my equally drunken yet kung-fu-challenged friends started acting up.</p>
<p>I made a conscious decision to spare no Photoshop trickery in the quest for the most arresting image. This decision is a direct result of viewing Andrzej Dragan's <a href="http://andrzejdragan.com/">gallery of light painting portraits</a>, achieved through a careful attention to light and exposure during shooting followed by the most impressive display of Rembrandt-esque manipulation I've seen.</p>
<p>So that's why I messed this one all up.<br />
