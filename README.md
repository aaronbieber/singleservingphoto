# Single-Serving Photo #

This is the content of my (in)famous blog, Single-Serving Photo, which I
authored for six years as I learned the craft of photography. It began as a
challenge to myself, to create and post photos with some frequency (at least
weekly), and grew into a powerful editorial and instructional outlet.

The version here has been shoddily converted from its original WordPress form
into a Jekyll site, which I will likely maintain through Octopress.
