## Who Are You?

My name is Aaron Bieber (no relation to Justin, seriously). Aside from being a
part-time traveling fine art photographer, I do a bit of freelance, and I also
build websites (for a living). My colleague Chris Blake and I travel and
[teach photography workshops](https://www.artphotoworkshops.com) and I've been
writing about photography on this blog for a bunch of years.

## Technical Mumbo-Jumbo

Some people are obsessed with technical details.

My first DSLR was a Canon EOS-10D, which I later upgraded to the EOS-5D. Eventually
I took the plunge into pro gear and moved to the EOS-1Ds Mark III, which was the
most money I've ever spent on a camera body.

After a few years shooting the 1Ds Mark III, I got really tired of carrying it
around, so I sold it, and all of my Canon lenses, and switched to the Sony Alpha
NEX-7.

I shot the NEX-7 for a few years again until my impatience with Sony to create a
proper successor to that model overcame me and I once again took the plunge into
the Sony Alpha a7 II, which is the full-frame mirrorless model.

Aside from its weight, I liked it a lot and so I shot it exclusively for a few
years until I was offered an opportunity to buy a friend's very lightly used
Sony Alpha a7R III, which I did, and which is now my main camera.
