<p>h2. Who Are You?</p>
<p>My name is Aaron Bieber (no relation to Justin, seriously). Aside from being a part-time traveling fine art photographer, I do a bit of freelance, and I also build websites (for a living). My colleague Chris Blake and I travel and "teach photography workshops":http://artphotoworkshops.com, and I've been writing about photography on this blog for several years.</p>
<p>h2. Technical Mumbo-Jumbo</p>
<p>Some people are obsessed with technical details. For the edification of those folks, I use a Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III digital SLR with a variety of lenses. At the top of every page you will find a link to my actual gallery website where you can view my photos, buy prints, and all that good stuff.</p>
